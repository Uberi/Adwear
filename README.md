## Inspiration

Did you ever wish you could monetize your terminal? We didn't. But now you can!

## What it does

Sidebar and popups ads for your terminal! You won't believe what happens next!

## How we built it

TMux, the terminal multiplexer, can be scripted to automatically set up terminal layouts. Command line ad scripts provide the ads themselves.

## Challenges we ran into

Making things work across Windows, Linux, and OS X: all of which were represented on the team.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Ads... in the terminal. Unlock the full description for $338.99.

## What we learned

Lots about TMux, curses, and interactive console applications. The pain of cross-platform programming.

## What's next for ADWEAR

The end goal is to be acquired by Google Adwords and have ADWEAR become part of the advertising portfolio.
